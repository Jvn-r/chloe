# DELI 7 - Commander & Executionar

## Objective
build a command from tokens and execute it

## Learning
- global vs main owned memory diffs
- command execution loop
- `strcat` string rebuilding frm `argv` 
- DEBUGGING, spent like 4 hrs on it, tokenizer is full of debug lines, ill clean it up later, still not fixed, just need to give correct spaces before using an operator, only `;` works

## Outcome
mediocre space handling shell with command builder + executionar
