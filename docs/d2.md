# DELI 2 — Input Reader and Tokenizer

## Objective
Implement an input pipeline and tokenization logic that gives output according to `CreateProcess` requirement

## Learning
- Input handling with `fgets`
- Newline char sanitization using `strcspn`
- Tokenization via `strtok`
- Construction of `argv` argument arrays
- Pointer vs array memory semantics in C

## Outcome
Built a reader and tokenizer and successfully integrated it with Windows process creation.
