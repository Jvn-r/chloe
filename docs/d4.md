# DELI 3 — Built-In Commands Differenciatoror

## Objective
handle builtin commands seperately away from the main loop, send only the non builtin commands into Create process

## Learning
- Usage of structs like dicts in python
- Array of structs usage
- Mapping name to function 
- No cross contamination of jobs: main -> executes, builtin checker -> checks and calls appropriate funcs, builtin funcs -> performs their things

## Outcome
Built-in commands handler, plus integration with main loop
