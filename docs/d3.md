# DELI 3 - Shell Loop + Exit out of loop

## Objective
Implement Shell loop, from Reading->Remonign Newline char->Copying into new Var->Tokenizer->Checkin for "exit"->CreateProc, and add the check for exit

## Learning
- How `strtok` changes affect variable interpretability by other funcs
- Separating raw command input from tokenized data
- `argv[0]` for identifying Built-in functions
- String Comparison via `strcmp` 
- Code Optimization by Subtracting and Usage of `void`  

## Outcome
Shell loop implemented, with a working `exit` built-in
